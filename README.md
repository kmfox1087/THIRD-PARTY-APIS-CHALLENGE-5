## Description

For the 5th project of MSU Bootcamp, we were tasked with creating JavaScript that worked with the starter code we were given. We had to have the time sections change color
depending on the time of day. We also had to use JS to call the current time and keep it updated so that our scheduler would be accurate. 

## User Story

* AS AN employee with a busy schedule
* I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
* SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
* THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a timeblock
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist


## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Go to [ssh key for repo will go here] and copy SSH 
* Use _git clone_ in your terminal and copy and paste the SSH code to your local computer
* Use _git status_ to make sure you are in the repo, if not use _cd Bootcamp-Challenge-3_ in your terminal to change into your local repo
